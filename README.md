# ✨ Overview of the app

The Minesweeper project created with Javascript is a digital version of the classic game where players uncover hidden mines on a grid.

The objective of the game is to clear the grid of mines without detonating any of them. 

The game is typically played by clicking on squares to reveal what is hidden underneath, with the goal of identifying all of the mines on the grid. It can be implemented using various programming languages, with JavaScript being one of the popular choices due to its flexibility and the ability to create interactive user interfaces.
